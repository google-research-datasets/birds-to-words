# Birds-to-Words

This repository contains the _Birds-to-Words_ dataset, a collection of paragraph-length descriptions of the differences between pairs of [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org) bird photographs.

The Birds-to-Words dataset was introduced in the paper:

**Neural Naturalist: Generating Fine-Grained Image Comparisons**<br/>
[Maxwell Forbes](http://maxwellforbes.com/), [Christine KÃ¤ser-Chen](https://twitter.com/kaeserchen), [Piyush Sharma](https://ai.google/research/people/PiyushSharma), [Serge Belongie](http://blogs.cornell.edu/techfaculty/serge-belongie/)<br/>
_EMNLP 2019_

The data is provided in the file `birds-to-words-v1.0.tsv` in this repository.
